        <h2>Email Peek - An iOS app built using Office 365</h2>
        <p>Email Peek is a cool mail app built using the Office 365 APIs on the iOS platform. This app allows you to peek at just the email conversations you truly care about when you are away, such as when you are on vacation and also optionally send quick replies to messages without typing. This app uses many of the rich features of the Office 365 APIs such as server-side filtering, categories, etc.</p>
